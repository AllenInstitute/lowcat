\title{Compute jaccard similarity values based on GenomicRanges overlaps in parallel.}
\usage{
run_fragment_overlap_jaccard_parallel(fragment_list, n_cores = 6,
  cluster_type = "PSOCK")
}
\arguments{
\item{fragment_list}{The list object containing GenomicRanges objects.}

\item{n_cores}{The number of cores to use in parallel. Use "auto" to detect and use all cores. Default is 6.}

\item{cluster_type}{EXPERIMENTAL: Either "PSOCK" (for Windows) or "FORK" (possible on Linux and Mac). FORK is more memory-efficient.}

\item{sample_names}{Sample names. If NULL, will use BAM file names.}
}
\value{
a list of GenomicRanges objects
}
